# Brewdog



### Use Case

Brewdog is one of the largest craft beer manufacturers in the UK. Their marketing department has been given the task to increase their email userbase, in order to improve the revenue stream atttributed to email marketing. The marketing department has approached me to build an interactive website with a quiz so that the marketing department can capture email addresses of potential customers. A nice to have would also be a searchable library of all the beers Brewdog sells.
