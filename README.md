# Brewdog



### Use Case

Brewdog is one of the largest craft beer manufacturers in the UK. Their marketing department has been given the task to increase their email userbase, in order to improve the revenue stream atttributed to email marketing. The marketing department has approached me to build an interactive website with a quiz so that the marketing department can capture email addresses of potential customers. A nice to have would also be a searchable library of all the beers Brewdog sells.

### Performance

Google Lighthouse was used to measure performance of each page

Performance has been impacted main by third party resources, please see known bugs for more information. Performance is throttled by 3rd party libraries namely:
* Index page - YouTube's JS library required to embed videos
* All pages - Bootstrap's CSS and JS CDN and Google font's CDN. The option to install Bootstrap files directly into the project was considered, but maintaining upgrades and changes to Bootstrap files would require new packages to be downloaded and installed. Using a CDN was decided the best way to counteract this.

All images are taken using Chrome's built-in Lighthouse tool, measured on mobile. Desktop version yield better results

## Bugs

| **Bug** | **Fix** |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Links to social media pages are not live | Gym needs to setup necessary social media pages and provide links/names |
| The contact form does not work | Build a PHP script to handle sending messages from the website |
| The contact form is not using required attributes | Add required to  HTML input |
| Youtube video on index page loads heavy unused JS files, impacting performance | These originate from the Youtube API so we cannot defer them using HTML. Either lazy load the video using JS or use a light embed |
| GIF on 404 page is 1mb and impacts performance | Convert the GIF to video, serve the GIF via a CDN, implement lazy loading or change to a static image |
| Photos are not being served using next gen format | Convert .jpg and .png images to .webp |
| Images are not being cached | Serve static assets with an efficient cache policy |
| Bootstrap, FontAwesome and Google Fonts require JS and CSS files that impact performance | Load the scripts using async, or defer attribute to avoid blocking document parsing |
